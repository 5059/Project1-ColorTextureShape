1. creating a color histogram
Parameters:
   image (OpenCV Mat object)
   clustering strategy (k-means, none, other)
     - or we can just assume k-means, then we'd just pass in the number of clusters
   quantization levels?
     - how do we define these?
Output:
   histogram object (potentially just a 1D array?)

2. creating color correlogram
Parameters:
	 image (OpenCV Mat object)
	 distance
	 clustering
	 Q levels
	 Auto-correlogram flag(?)
Output:
   correlogram object (I think this ends up being a 3D array)
   
We'd need a sub-function for running color-pairs (on distance D)

3. creating local binary pattern histogram
Parameters:
  image
	neighborhood size
	uniform flag
Outpute:
  histogram

4. creating histogram of oriented gradient
Parameters:
  image
	rectangular or circular blocks
	gradient vector
	normalization strategy (L1norm, L2norm, L1sqrt, L2hys)
Output:
  histogram
