Distance Measures
L1
The L1 distance, we also call it absolute distance, city-block distance or Manhattan distance.

Input: two histograms of the same type: HI and HJ
Output:   
L2
The L2 distance, we also call it Euclidean distance. 

Input: two histograms of the same type: HI and HJ
Output:   
KL
The KL distance, Motivated from Information Theory, KL is the cost of encoding one distribution as another, KL distances is the average of KL(I, J) and KL(J, I). We need to make the denominator is not 0 and check the logarithm of the number to the base e is not 0.

Chi-Square
Motivated from nonparametric Chi-Square (ÔÅ£2) test statistics. We need to make sure the denominator is not 0.
